# circus
[LIVE SITE WIP](https://www.natedonato.com/circus/)

My "circus" page is a directory of smaller attractions / interactive web pages.  I have been adding at least one page daily and hope to keep this up for the rest of the year.


# Past day writeups:

## Day 1: Strobe Light
A simple light switch that activates a strobe effect.  Not recommended for anyone with epilepsy / flashing color sensitivity.  Vanilla JS and DOM manipulation.

To be added: speed slider and color picker.

## Day 2: Drumpad
Interactive virtual drumpad based off a JavaScript30 project.  Really fun to bang out some beats!  Uses HTML audio elements and keydown / CSS transition events.

To be added: sound selection, mobile accessible interface.

## Day 3: Succs
Spinning succulents.  What more could you want?
Simple CSS animation practice with mouseover events, spin direction is randomized and reverses back to original position.

To be added: 

## Day 4: DressCat
A cat dress up game in pure JS / CSS / DOM manipulation.  Much of the work was spent in photoshop instead of vs code.

To be added: more artwork

## Day 5: Meditate
A meditation web app using React.  Set a timer, choose from optional calming background sounds including waves, rain, and prayer bowls, and give yourself a moment to relax.

To be added: chime alert on end, better mobile styling.
